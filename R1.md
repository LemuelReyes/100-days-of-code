## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode -

### Day 1: January 28 (Sunday) 2018

**Today's Progress**: First day, wanted to keep it simple. Been meaning to try CSS GRID, so I tried it out today and created a layout of a desktop size youtube video with a side bar containing three rows for recommended videos.  

**Thoughts:**: There's a similarity between CSS GRID and Flexbox, where there is a parent container and children element that you play around with.
Useful for creating layouts for future projects. Looking forward to reinforcing what I've learnt.

### Day 2: January 29 (Monday) 2018

**Today's Progress**: More CSS GRID material, learning about grid columns, rows, areas, shorthand methods and templates. Exercises were layout manipulation that required me to poison weed and water carrots by using css grid.

**Thoughts:**: I can start to see the difference between flexbox and css grid, both are amazing of their own. Away with the oldschool way of doing tables!
