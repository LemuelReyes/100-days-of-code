## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode -

### Day 1: January 28 (Sunday) 2018

**Today's Progress**: First day, wanted to keep it simple. Been meaning to try CSS GRID, so I tried it out today and created a layout of a desktop size youtube video with a side bar containing three rows for recommended videos.  

**Thoughts:**: There's a similarity between CSS GRID and Flexbox, where there is a parent container and children element that you play around with.
Useful for creating layouts for future projects. Looking forward to reinforcing what I've learnt.

### Day 2: January 29 (Monday) 2018

**Today's Progress**: More CSS GRID material, learning about grid columns, rows, areas, shorthand methods and templates. Exercises were layout manipulation that required me to poison weed and water carrots by using css grid.

**Thoughts:**: I can start to see the difference between flexbox and css grid, both are amazing of their own. Away with the oldschool way of doing tables!

### Day 3: January 30 (Tuesday) 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reinforcing Javascript fundamentals. On the summer of 2017, I worked my way from the beginning of the FCC Front End Curriculum
to Advanced Algorithms, unfortunately I stopped there. Picking back up by powering through the basic Javascript section and onto new material on the beta version. I would like to claim my Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures certificate in the near future.

**Thoughts:**: 182 hours estimated to complete the curriculum. Need to grind.

### Day 4: January 31 (Wednesday) 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic Javascript section of the FCC curriculum. Learned different kinds of loops, objects, boolean values, switch statements, conditional logic, operators and arrays.

**Thoughts:**: I feel good that I did a refresher walk through of this section and gives me more confidence moving forward in the curriculum.
