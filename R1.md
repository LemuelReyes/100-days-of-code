### Day 1: January 28 (Sunday) 2018

**Today's Progress**: First day, wanted to keep it simple. Been meaning to try CSS GRID, so I tried it out today and created a layout of a desktop size youtube video with a side bar containing three rows for recommended videos.  

**Thoughts:**: There's a similarity between CSS GRID and Flexbox, where there is a parent container and children element that you play around with.
Useful for creating layouts for future projects. Looking forward to reinforcing what I've learnt.
